                <h2>Tyler Thompson</h2>
                <p>One of the elusive blue wizards mentioned in "The Hobbit". Tyler     first appeared as a Team Leader for
                    a Build Week, and used his powers of good to lead the small band of comrades on their merry quest.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Jamea Kidrick</h2>
                <p>The elven princess that gave up her crown and immortal life for      the love of the dark arts of coding.
                    She can usually be found concocting a brew of elven magic to help the fellowship achieve success in
                    their quest for Build Week excellence.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Javier Martinez</h2>
                <p>It has long been rumored that Javier fell in love with a fair        maiden and gave up his quest to drink
                    all the flavors of mead and ale in all the taverns and pubs that dot the landscape of the land of
                    Lambda.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>David Isakson II </h2>
                <a href="https://github.com/ikeman32" id = ikeman32> Ikeman32</a>
                <p>King Isakson the second of his name has ruled over the kingdom       of Lambda for an age. He is well known
                    for his defeat of the foul beast "React" and as legend has it, many lesser beasts of his kingdom.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Dan Cashion</h2>
                <a href="https://github.com/dgcash01" id = dgcash01> dgcash01</a>
                <p>This jolly fellow had very few responsibilities within the           fellowship. Mentioning his name was the mere
                    musing of a drunken bard.</p>
